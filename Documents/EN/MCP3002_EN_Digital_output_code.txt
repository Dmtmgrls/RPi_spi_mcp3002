4.2 Digital Output Code
The digital output code produced by an A/D Converter
is a function of the input signal and the reference
voltage. For the MCP3002, VDD is used as the
reference voltage.
As the VDD level is reduced, the LSB size is reduced
accordingly. The theoretical digital output code
produced by the A/D Converter is shown below.


LSB Size = VREF / 1024


Digital Output Code = 1024*VIN / VDD


Where:
VIN = analog input voltage
VDD = supply voltage
