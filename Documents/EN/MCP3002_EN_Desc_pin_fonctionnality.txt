3.1 Analog Inputs (CH0/CH1)
Analog inputs for channels 0 and 1 respectively. These
channels can programmed to be used as two
independent channels in single ended-mode or as a
single pseudo-differential input where one channel is
IN+ and one channel is IN-. See Section 5.0 “Serial
Communications” for information on programming
the channel configuration.
3.2 Chip Select/Shutdown (CS/SHDN)
The CS/SHDN pin is used to initiate communication
with the device when pulled low and will end a
conversion and put the device in low power standby
when pulled high. The CS/SHDN pin must be pulled
high between conversions.
3.3 Serial Clock (CLK)
The SPI clock pin is used to initiate a conversion and to
clock out each bit of the conversion as it takes place.
See Section 6.2 “Maintaining Minimum Clock
Speed” for constraints on clock speed.
3.4 Serial Data Input (DIN)
The SPI port serial data input pin is used to clock in
input channel configuration data.
3.5 Serial Data Output (DOUT)
The SPI serial data output pin is used to shift out the
results of the A/D conversion. Data will always change
on the falling edge of each clock as the conversion
takes place.
